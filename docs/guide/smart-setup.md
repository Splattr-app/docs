# Using the Smart Setup

The "Smart setup" wizard is the easiest way to get a high-quality result without needing to be an expert in every parameter.

### How it Works

When you click the "Smart setup" button on the configuration page, a guided wizard will appear. It will ask you a series of simple, high-level questions about your project, such as:

- What type of camera did you use (Standard, Fisheye, 360°)?
- What is the main subject of your scene (An object, a room, an outdoor area)?
- What is your priority (Fastest speed, best quality, or a balance)?

Based on your answers, our system will automatically select the best combination of advanced settings for the Data Processing and Training stages.

### Who Should Use It?

- **Beginners:** If you're new to Gaussian Splatting, this is the recommended path.
- **Quick Results:** If you just want a great result quickly without fine-tuning, the wizard is the fastest way to start a job.

You can always start with the Smart setup and then switch back to the manual configuration page to see which settings it chose for you and make further adjustments if needed.
