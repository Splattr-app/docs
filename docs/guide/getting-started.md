# Getting Started

Welcome to Splattr! This guide will walk you through creating your first project using our new, streamlined workflow.

### 1. Select Your Input Type

The first step is to tell Splattr what kind of data you're starting with. You can choose between raw media (Photos or Videos) or a pre-aligned dataset.

- **[Learn more about Input Types](./input-types.md)**

### 2. Upload Your Files

Drag and drop your files. You can also import from previous uploads or connect a cloud storage account like Google Drive or Dropbox.
Please note that you can use previous uploads only if you those past media were uploaded to Splattr and not other cloud storage services.

### 3. Configure Your Job

This is where the magic happens. You have two paths:

- **Smart Setup (Recommended for Beginners):** Click the "Smart setup" button. Our guided wizard will ask you a few simple questions about your project and automatically choose the best settings for you. This is the easiest way to get a great result. **[Learn more about Smart Setup](./smart-setup.md)**

- **Manual Configuration:** For advanced users who want full control, you can dive into the detailed settings. You can configure everything from the server type to the finest details of the training process. **[See the Full Settings Reference](../reference/job-configuration.md)**

### 4. Begin Processing

Once you're happy with your settings, the "Processing preview" on the right will show you the cost. Click "Begin processing" to start the job. You can close the window; we'll notify you when your splat is complete!
