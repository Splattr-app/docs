1.  **Click "New Splat":** From your dashboard, click the "New Splat" button. Give your project a name.
2.  **Upload Your Media:** Drag and drop your video file(s) or a folder of images directly onto the upload area. For pre-processed projects, upload your ZIP file.
3.  **Configure Your Job:** For your first time, the default settings are a great place to start! You can leave everything as-is.
