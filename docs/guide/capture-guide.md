# Capture Best Practices

The quality of your final result depends almost entirely on the quality of your input data. Follow these guides for best results.

## For Video Shoots (Recommended for Beginners)

- **Slow, Smooth Movement:** Move the camera slowly and smoothly around your subject in an arc or orbital path. Avoid jerky movements. Imagine you are "painting" the subject with your camera, ensuring you cover every surface.
- **Good, Even Lighting:** Shoot in well-lit conditions. Overcast days are perfect. Avoid harsh, direct sunlight that creates dark shadows, as these can confuse the process.
- **Static Scenes Only:** The subject and the environment must be completely still. Do not try to capture moving people, cars, pets, or trees blowing in the wind.
- **Keep in Focus:** Ensure your subject remains in sharp focus throughout the entire video.

## For Photo Sets (Advanced)

- **Massive Overlap:** Each photo should overlap with the previous one by at least 70-80%. More overlap is always better.
- **Full Coverage:** Walk around your subject, taking photos from multiple heights (low, eye-level, high). Don't forget the top! The more angles you provide, the better the reconstruction.
- **Consistent Settings:** Do not change your camera's focal length (zoom) or exposure settings during the shoot.
- **No Motion Blur:** Ensure every photo is sharp and free of motion blur.
